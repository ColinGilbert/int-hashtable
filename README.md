This is an extraction of the hash table from https://github.com/preshing/CompareIntegerMaps which accompanied the blog http://preshing.com/20130107/this-hash-table-is-faster-than-a-judy-array/.

Code made slightly more standard (removed a few redefines and added standard header files) and the namespace "preshing" was added to make life easier for client programmers.
